Julia Larson (Engineering '26) presented her research on haptic corrective feedback during exercise at the [Virginia Academy of Science Annual Meeting](https://www.vacadsci.org/2025_annual_meeting.php) at the University of Virginia. Her work examines whether feedback at the site of muscle activation is comparable or more effective than methods which target movement of the individual limb or joint. Her poster is available online ([PDF](/assets/pdf/larson-vas-poster.pdf)).
