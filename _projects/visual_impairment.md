## Support for Visual Impairment

**Passive Haptic Learning for Braille Writing**

Megan Caulfield presented the results of her honors thesis, ["Braille Learning using Haptic Feedback"](/assets/pdf/caulfield-sieds2024.pdf) at the 2024 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Sympossium on May 3rd at the University of Virginia. Her research examined the effectiveness of haptic feedback when learning to read and write braille which is motivated by the challenges of sighted parents and teachers learning braille to suppor their visually impaired children and students. She was advised by myself, [Dr. Laura Deportes](https://www.jmu.edu/coe/people/desportes-laura.shtml) (Education), and [Dr. Daniel Castaneda](https://www.jmu.edu/cise/people/faculty/castaneda-daniel.shtml) (Engineering). A special thanks also to the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind for allowing us to tour their facilities.
