## Support for Visual Impairment

**Passive Haptic Learning for Braille Writing**

Megan Caulfield presented the results of her honors thesis, ["Braille Learning using Haptic Feedback"](/assets/pdf/caulfield-sieds2024.pdf) at the 2024 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Sympossium on May 3rd at the University of Virginia. Her research examined the effectiveness of haptic feedback when learning to read and write braille which is motivated by the challenges of sighted parents and teachers learning braille to suppor their visually impaired children and students. She was advised by myself, [Dr. Laura Deportes](https://www.jmu.edu/coe/people/desportes-laura.shtml) (Education), and [Dr. Daniel Castaneda](https://www.jmu.edu/cise/people/faculty/castaneda-daniel.shtml) (Engineering). A special thanks also to the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind for allowing us to tour their facilities.

### Peripersonal Navigation

We have significant collaborations with [Dr. Sol Lim](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/lim.html) in the [Occupational Ergonomics and Biomechanics (OEB) Laboratories](https://oeb.ise.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech. We have directly supported the work of Mahdis Tajdari by developing custom hardware to provide haptic feedback. Her research explores how various haptic patterns help persons with vision impairment locate objects and navigate peripersonal space.

This work has been supported by 4-VA:

- **4-VA Grant** ($30,000, awarded 2022): "Supporting College Students with Impaired Vision in a Shared Housing Through Haptic-Guided Peripersonal Navigation" with [Dr. Sol Lim](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/lim.html) (Virginia Tech, PI) and Dr. Michael Stewart (JMU, Co-PI)
