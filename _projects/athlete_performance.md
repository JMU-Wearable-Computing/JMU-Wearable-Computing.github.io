Athletic performance measures are critical for understanding an athlete's explosive power and strength. Traditional methods for calculating metrics like the Reactive Strength Index (RSI) require expensive force plates that are stationary and difficult to deploy in field settings. Our research explores using low-cost, lightweight inertial measurement units (IMUs) as alternative for measuring athlete performance.

Our recent work applies the low-cost measures, and high-fidelity motion capture, to assist [JMU Softball](https://www.instagram.com/jmusoftball/) in evaluating athlete performance and recovery.


### Reactive Strength Index Research

Undergraduate researcher Stephen Mitchell led a multi-year effort to validate IMU-based measurements of the Drop Jump Ratio, a key component of calculating RSI. His work demonstrated that low-cost wearable sensors can effectively capture the kinematic data needed to assess athletic performance without the limitations of traditional force plates.

Stephen's research was presented at multiple venues:
- **MARCUS 2019**: Initial findings on IMU-based drop jump measurements ([abstract](/assets/pdf/mitchell-marcus-abstract.pdf), [poster](/assets/pdf/mitchell-marcus-poster.pdf))
- **IEEE SouthEast Conference 2021**: Extended analysis ([short paper](/assets/pdf/MitchellS-T7S2-ieee-ready.pdf), [presentation](/assets/pdf/Mitchell-IEEE-Presentation.pdf))
- **SIEDS 2021**: Full publication with full user study ([full paper](/assets/pdf/mitchell-sieds-camera-ready.pdf))


This work was conducted in collaboration with [Dr. Stu Thompson](http://www.bucknell.edu/fac-staff/stu-thompson) (Bucknell University, Electrical and Computer Engineering) and [Dr. Rosha Wunderlich](https://www.jmu.edu/biology/people/current-people/faculty/faculty-wunderlich.shtml) (JMU Biology).
