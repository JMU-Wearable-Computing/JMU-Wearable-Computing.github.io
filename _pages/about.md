The Wearable Computing Group at James Madison University explores the impact of wearable computing systems on human health, performance, and safety. Our research spans a wide breath from physical therapy, sports science, interaction with autonomous systems, and musical performance. Undergraduate research is a cornerstone of our practice. We actively recruit students to conduct research, present their work publically, and travel to academic venues and campuses. Our current students and alumni are available online.

The research group is housed within the Department of Engineering in the Human-Computer Interaction + Design Lab and is directed by [Dr. Jason Forsyth](https://www.jasonforsyth.net), [Dr. Chris Johnson](https://www.jmu.edu/cise/people/faculty/johnson-chris.shtml), and [Prof. Tara Burns](https://www.taraleeburns.com). The lab maintains significant hardware capabilities in motion capture, wearable data capture and feedback, and deep learning. 

We welcome any questions and potential collaborators. Please email Dr. Jason Forsyth, forsy2jb {at} jmu.edu to get connected.
